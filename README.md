Indexing and Embedding:
Data preparation: The external data source (documents, knowledge base, etc.) is chunked into smaller units (paragraphs, sentences, or relevant units).
Embedding: Each chunk is converted into a mathematical representation using an embedding model like Word2Vec or Doc2Vec, capturing semantic relationships between words.
Indexing: The embedded chunks are organized in a searchable data structure like Faiss or HNSW for efficient retrieval based on their vector representations.
Prompt Encoding and Retrieval:
Prompt processing: The user's prompt or question is also converted into an embedding similar to the data chunks.
Nearest neighbor search: The system searches the index for chunks with embeddings most similar to the prompt embedding, utilizing algorithms like nearest neighbor search.
Filtering and aggregation: Top candidate chunks are chosen based on factors like confidence scores, distance thresholds, or relevance criteria. They might be aggregated or weighted based on their significance.

Prompt Augmentation and Generation:
Enriched prompt: The retrieved chunks are integrated into the original prompt, forming an augmented prompt with richer context and relevant information.
LLM-driven generation: The augmented prompt is fed to the LLM like any other prompt. The LLM leverages its internal knowledge and the augmented context to generate a response.
Generation types: The response can be directly answering the question, summarizing the retrieved information, incorporating details from retrieved chunks.
